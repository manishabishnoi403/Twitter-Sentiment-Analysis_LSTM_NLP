# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis_LSTM_NLP
Twitter Sentiment Classifier (LSTM + NLP)

This project is a **Streamlit web app** that predicts the **sentiment of tweets** (Positive / Neutral / Negative) using a trained **LSTM deep learning model**.

This project is a Twitter Sentiment Classifier built with an LSTM deep learning model and deployed using Streamlit.
It takes any tweet as input and predicts whether the sentiment is Positive, Neutral, or Negative. The model is trained on tweet data, with preprocessing handled through tokenization and sequence padding. 
A simple and interactive web interface allows users to quickly test tweets and get instant predictions.
